What does it do?

This software is so we can follow people at competitions in a more convenient way.
It will be put into nibblrjr, who will announce event/competitor progress as
it unfolds.


1.  Track competitors progress during a specific comp
2.  Track competitions (overall)
3.  Track competitor stats (did they get a new PB?  what's the best/worst?)
4.  
5.
6.
7.
8.
9.
10.

To Do:
Get List of competitions - Done
When retrieving competitions, save results, check against that instead of continually calling remote (obviously special calls for live comps)
Create "Find" function for competitions - DONE
       Competition searches should not have to be exact.  e.g. Big Old Competition should be found from 'big old' or 'big comp' -DONE
Create "Find" function for competitors
       Competitor searches should not have to be exact.  same thing.
Get Competitor Status
    Present Competitor Status
Get Competition Status (e.g. what event, how far along, etc)


Consider:
present options if multiples are found, or make them be more precise?  (
Example, "open" search will yield many results)
